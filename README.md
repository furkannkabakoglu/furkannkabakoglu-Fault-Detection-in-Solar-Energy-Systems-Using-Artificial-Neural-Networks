This study aims to detect faults in solar energy systems using artificial neural networks. Rapid and accurate fault detection is crucial for the efficiency and sustainability of solar energy systems. For this purpose, an artificial neural network model has been developed using data obtained from solar panels. The model can detect faults based on parameters such as solar panel voltage, current, and temperature. The model has been trained using data normalization and backpropagation algorithms, with performance enhancement achieved through hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation techniques. The model's accuracy has been evaluated by separating training and test data. The results show that the developed artificial neural network model can detect faults in solar energy systems with high accuracy. This study provides significant contributions to the reliable and efficient monitoring of solar energy systems.
